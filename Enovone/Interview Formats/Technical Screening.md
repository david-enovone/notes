# Background &  Work History

*Ask for the candidate to provide some relevant work history and background. Take note of examples that may be relevant to our current needs. When appropriate, ask follow up questions to get a better sense of what the work the candidate has done.*



# Technical Aptitude Questions
The goal of this section is to get an assessment of what languages and technologies the candidate is familiar with.

## Software & Systems

### Self Assessments
Ask to self assess, one (1) to five (5), and then ask why they gave themselves this score. If the score is high ask how they earned that level. If the score is low, ask what would they need to learn next to grow.

Use the notes section to capture this feedback and your assessment of the scores reliability. 


| Skill      | Score (1-5) | Notes |
| ---------- | ----------- |:----- |
| Python     |             |       |
| TypeScript |             |       |
| Postgres   |             |       |
| AWS        |             |       |
| Heroku     |             |       |
| Django     |             |       |
| React      |             |       |
|            |             |       |
|            |             |       |


### Principles

Inquire what software principles the candidate is familiar with, and what **work experience** they may have with them:

| Principle                  | Familiarity | Work Experience (Years) |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| SOLID                      |             |                         |
| DRY                        |             |                         |
| Domain-driven Design (DDD) |             |                         |
| Test-driven Design (TDD)   |             |                         |
|                            |             |                         |
