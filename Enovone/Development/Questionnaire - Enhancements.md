# Problem Statement
Feedback received was:
> Address the questionnaire. And the comment that I have heard multiple times: if we change the questions it will break all the logic. 
> This is not okay, the questions are not right NOW and will constantly be needs to be updated. 
> Chantal has plans for templated surveys please connect with her and establish a plan: by when and how do we get there.


# Discovery
## Unknowns
- Where is the logic for how weights are supposed to work documented?
	- This seems like a core business use, we should stipulate it somewhere.
When the weights total up and meet a threshold, this places you into a group/label
 
## Observations
Looks like this is iteration is inspired by a few different open source examples of surveys, and follows some version of a Builder.
