1. **Branching Strategy**
    - Follow process outlined in the Git Branching document

1. **Creating a Pull Request**    
    - **Commit Changes**: Commit changes to your feature branch with clear and concise commit messages.
    - **Push Branch**: Push your feature branch to the remote repository.
    - **Open PR**: Open a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch to the main branch.
        - **Title**: Use a clear and descriptive title.
        - **Description**: Provide a brief description of what the PR does, including any relevant context, screenshots, or links to related issues.
1. **PR Review Process**    
    - **Assign Reviewers**: Assign at least one team member to review the PR.
    - **Automated Checks**: Ensure all automated tests and checks (if any) pass. This includes CI/CD pipelines, code linting, and unit tests.
    - **Review**: Reviewers should:
        - Check for code quality and adherence to coding standards.
        - Verify the functionality and logic.
        - Suggest improvements or changes if needed.
    - **Comments**: Leave constructive comments on any issues or suggestions for improvement.
    - **Approval**: Once the reviewer is satisfied, they should approve the PR.
4. **Addressing Feedback**
    - **Respond to Comments**: Address all feedback by making the necessary changes and replying to comments.
    - **Re-request Review**: Once changes are made, re-request a review from the assigned reviewers.
5. **Merging the PR**
    - **Final Checks**: Ensure all discussions are resolved and all checks pass.
    - **Squash and Merge**: Prefer squash and merge to keep the main branch history clean. This consolidates all commits from the feature branch into a single commit.
    - **Delete Branch**: Delete the feature branch after merging to keep the repository tidy.
6. **Post-Merge**
    - **Deploy**: If applicable, deploy the changes to a staging or production environment.
    - **Monitor**: Monitor the application for any issues that might arise from the new changes.

### Additional Tips

- **Small PRs**: Encourage small, focused PRs to make reviews quicker and easier.
- **Communication**: Keep communication open and respectful. Use PR descriptions and comments effectively.
- **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made in the PR.
