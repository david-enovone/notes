 > In preparation of our meeting - this is what I will want to talk about: I am working on a roadmap for tomorrow of breaking down dev tasks that could benefit all product lines. From a meeting with Dylan Ben and Mandi on friday - it became obvious that 1. if we donâ€™t work on the reporting processes (making it automated and fast), the bottle neck will increase no matter what.. 2. tracking and traceability of the users - so that if things stop we know where they are and what s going on and we can create actions or improvement that will help them complete their journey. ..and any other crucial development tasks that would be beneficial for everyone.. I have a few in mind..
