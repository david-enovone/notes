	- Bug fixes: 
	- Features: 

Stand Up:
Y
	- Roll out backfill
	- Implement first iteration for algo change
T
	- Sprint Planning
	- Admin tool for new scoring
	- Integrate to fill out customer json recommendations
B
	- Blocked by lack of time on Questionnaire and HIPAA
	- Will resume these later in the week


End of Day Updates:
	- Sitting at about six to eight hours of remaining work to reach feature complete on my tasks. 
		- Running into mental and physical fatigue; a little burnt all in all. Will need to step away and let my mind rest as I'm losing effectiveness. 
		- The remaining tasks should be pretty much ready for me to finalize testing and rollout tomorrow
		- This will hit my commit goals
	- Promoted Slava to admin on the Dr Portal repo
		- Makes sense IMHO as we work opposite time zones and I'm moving off of it as my primary
