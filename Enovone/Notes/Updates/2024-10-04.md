End of Day Updates:
- Blocked on rollout till I can get git lfs to work on Heroku - will be doing that throughout the evening 
- My call w/ Karen required me to step away and reset. 
	- Though it goes without saying, I did ensure my hourly tracker marked me as 'Not working' during this time.
- I've continued to run into odd "gotchas" while deploying these migrations and testing its implementation, while now that I go to note it I'm drawing blanks on the specifics, one does jump out at me: 
	  - For awhile I couldn't run migrations as "datetime" package from Python refused to admit it existed until I restarted my shell
	  - I'm not sure if this a Linux Python only issue, a venv issue, or perhaps a combination of my personal choices on toolchain. 
		  - Ultimately this is just a curiosity, no time to look too deep into it. 
  - Trying to field questions and offer support in the `#engineering` channel

Long night ahead, will return.
