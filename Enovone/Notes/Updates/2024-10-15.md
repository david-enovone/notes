End of Day Updates:
	- I lost a significant chunk of my day due to a sudden change in how HubStaff behaves on my computer
		- When the process is running, not even recording, it continues to interrupt CPU threads
		- I chased down the issue through a few hours of systems debugging
			- Without my workstation I could not work
		- I was watching for CPU interrupts on the `powertop` util when I noticed HubStaff would constantly spike and draw all power from my PC, locking up all threads.
		- I believe there's a process to file bugs with HubStaff, when I have time later, I will gather data and file one
	- I have implemented the first iteration for algo changes
		- I am working on the Django admin tool for it.
		- I have opted for a JSONB field, and I thought using a tool like `django-json-widget` would be helpful
		- Trying this out and will share with Eissa
	- Returning to rolling out backfill afterwards.
	- Will have more updates throughout the night.
