End of Day Updates:
- Rolled out some bug fixes for both PGX and what we're seeing in Sentry
- Had a good alignment call w/ Alen on where my focus should be
- Will be preparing feature specs for sprint planning
- Continuing to provide bug fixes for prod
	- Right now it appears you cannot use our app without hitting at least one error; we should look to limit this
- Trying to replace the other PGX reports to use the DB optimized approach.
	- There's a small fundamental difference, as the medications one uses a query to join the values, but, the other reports will provide the data as variables
	- I believe I know of a way to work around this.
