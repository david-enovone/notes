## Summary
Alen still seems to think when I reference my past experiences I'm speaking in context of large companies, even when I reassure him I am not. 

This doesn't seem to be unique to just Alen; there seems to be an impression that I can only speak to how larger orgs operate. I have spent equal time at larger orgs and away from larger orgs.
