Executive Summary
At this time I am recommending a no hire for the candidate.  There is a misalignment in multiple key areas that impact this decision. 


Logic outline:

1. Misalignment on IC role. 
	1. Candidate was not aware that they would need to contribute to feature development.
	2. Candidate was unable to work through the entry level live coding exercise.
2. Misalignment on skillset
	1. Only 1 year of experience in React
	2. No experience with Python or Postgres.
	3. No experience with building user facing features on a live product.
	4. While CS degree focused on ML, the candidate admitted that since 2005 they have not kept up to date with latest technology.
	5. Candidate, though they have extensive technical leadership experience, could not expand on or talk to implementation details beyond macro.
3. Coding interview non-starter and integrity failure
	1. Candidate admitted that, under normal circumstances, they would rely upon ChatGPT to provide an answer to the problem.
	2. Candidate admitted that the abstract complexity of the problem was overwhelming and froze up.
	3. While I tried to coach and prompt the Candidate to evaluate the problem, the Candidate was looking at, and interacting with, other screens. After a few moments of obvious reading, they would jump in with an idea on what to do next.
		1. To me this is an failure of integrity. The candidate was asked not to use ChatGPT or any coding assistance, and if they wished to do an "open book" interview that they share their screen.
	4. Even after coaching, prompting, and dictating how we could work through the problem together -- including providing the first few lines -- the candidate expressed discomfort with continuing.
	5. When given the choice to either continue the live coding or go back to chatting, the Candidate indicated they'd prefer to return to talking and they would think of a solution and get back to me.
		1. I corrected this assumption and informed the Candidate that if I gave another coding interview I would not use the same questions.



# Executive Summary
The interview revealed significant gaps between the candidateâ€™s experience and the role's requirements. The candidate lacked familiarity with key technologies, including React, Python, and PostgreSQL, and has not kept up with technological advancements since 2005.

During the live coding exercise, the candidate struggled with basic problem-solving and expressed discomfort despite guidance. Concerns about integrity arose as the candidate appeared to use external resources against instructions.

Given these factors, the recommendation is **No hire**. The candidate does not meet the technical or role-specific requirements.

# Misalignment on Individual Contributor (IC) Role

- **Feature Development:** The candidate was unaware that the position required active contribution to feature development.
- **Technical Competency:** The candidate struggled to complete an entry-level live coding exercise.

# Skillset Misalignment

- **React Experience:** The candidate has only 1 year of experience with React, which I would consider Entry/Junior.
- **Technical Gaps:**
    - No experience with Python or PostgreSQL.
    - Lack of experience in building user-facing features for live products.
- **Outdated Knowledge:** Despite holding a CS degree with a focus on ML, the candidate has not kept up with recent technological advancements since 2005.
	- Could not speak to any fundamentals of LLMs
	- Could not provide any examples of how they've used LLMs, outside ChatGPT through a UI.
- **Limited Detail-Oriented Experience:** Although the candidate has extensive technical leadership experience, they were unable to discuss or elaborate on implementation details beyond a high-level perspective.

#  Concerns During the Coding Interview

- **Dependence on AI Assistance:** The candidate admitted they would typically rely on ChatGPT for solving coding problems.
- **Difficulty Handling Complexity:** The candidate felt overwhelmed by the abstract complexity of the problem and struggled to proceed.
	- The problem is ranked as "Easy" and 77%+ of submissions are accepted.
- **Integrity Issues:**
    - The candidate appeared to be using external resources despite being instructed not to use any coding assistance tools. 
	    - They were observed interacting with other screens and reading content before offering solutions, which raises concerns about integrity.
    - Even after being offered guidance and having the initial lines of code dictated, the candidate expressed discomfort and reluctance to continue.
	- **Quit Instead of Trying:** When given the choice to continue the live coding exercise or switch back to discussion, the candidate chose the latter, stating they would prefer to think of a solution and provide it later. 
		- I clarified that future coding exercises would involve different questions.
